# Bubble-sort-python

A python3 implementation of the bubble sort algorithm
Containing some code to compare it to the sort() python function (which implements the Timsort algorithm)

Some informations about the bubble sort algorithm :

```
Worst-case performance	    :   O(n²)
Best-case performance       :   O(n)
Average performance         :   O(n²)
Worst-case space complexity :   O(1)
```
