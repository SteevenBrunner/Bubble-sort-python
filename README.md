# Bubble-sort-python

A python3 implementation of the bubble sort algorithm, with a test part to compare the time to sort(): Timsort algorithm

Some informations about this sorting algorithm :

```
Worst-case performance	    :   O(n²)
Best-case performance       :   O(n)
Average performance         :   O(n²)
Worst-case space complexity :   O(1)
